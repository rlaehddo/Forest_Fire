Linear Regression Models on Montesinho Forest Fire 

## Dataset 
Dataset of Forest Fires retrieved from: 

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires?fbclid=IwAR3orFV-2u76MfAF1FbWfm-qtsCsP2OffZatnRAHgfaScgGRR2ET3vchWNQ

## Goals 
Linear Regression Models Used : 
1) AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) with Backward-step variabel selection 
2) LASSO 

Model Comparison through RMSE values from K-fold Cross validation (10-fold cross validation) 

Predicting log(y+1)-transformed forest fire areas by wildfires (given that area burnt is not 0)
